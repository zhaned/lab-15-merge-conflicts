# lab-15-merge-conflicts

## Reflecting on git merge conflicts
- They suck! 
- Always pull from main before starting to work on a new file. 
- Communicate and make sure we're not working on the same file at the same time.
- Set the settings so that PRs get voted in instead of pulled by one person
- Local merge conflicts can be fixed easier in VSCode
- Main branch conflicts are easier to fix
